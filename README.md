# 👽 Save Namek! 👽

Join Goku in his journey to save Namek from the tyrannical Frieza and his (less impressive but equally ugly) underlings - the Saibamen! Your goal is to defeat enough enemies to reach 300 points and save the planet! Will Frieza and his minions prevail, or will you save the day?

## Game Instructions:
- 🔥 Use the ↑, ↓, →, and ← key to control Goku
- 🚀 To speed up or slow down the pace of the game, use the + and - keys
- ❤️ Avoid the Saibamen and Frieza. Each collision with a Saibamen reduces 1 HP point, and each collision with Frieza reduces 2 HP points. You only start with 3 HP points, so be careful!
- ✨ Find and consume Senzu Beans to replenish Goku's HP, even Goku needs help beating his enemies at times.
- 🔥 Shoot ki-blasts by pressing the spacebar, one blast is enough to take out a lowly Saibaman (worth 20 points), and two is enough to ward off Frieza (worth 40 points), careful as you only have a limited supply!
- ⚡ Capture the Dragonballs to refuel Goku's energy in order to shoot more ki-blasts!
